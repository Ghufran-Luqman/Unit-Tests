# Unit-Tests
Unit testing practice, going from simple programs to more complex ones.  
This README is a 'journal' which I am using to help me learn about unit testing.  
There are multiple branches for different sections
## Double
With the function double, which simply doubles a given number, I am testing both if the function works perfectly and if the function does not work perfectly.
This way, I can see how the errors given from the test can help me debug the and discover the problem.
### Testing without pytest
This section is within the `nopytest` branch
### Testing with pytest
This section is within the `withpytest` branch
## FastAPI Testing
This section is within the `testfastAPI` branch
## Sources
The idea of the main python file and the tests come from Harvard CS50's lecture on unit tests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIrcxwLqzjQ  
I decided to look at a basic test for FastAPI and the code is sourced from this website: https://apidog.com/blog/unit-testing-fastapi/
