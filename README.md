# Unit-Tests
Unit testing practice, going from simple programs to more complex ones.  
This README is a 'journal' which I am using to help me learn about unit testing.  
There are multiple branches for different sections
## Double
With the function double, which simply doubles a given number, I am testing both if the function works perfectly and if the function does not work perfectly.
This way, I can see how the errors given from the test can help me debug the and discover the problem.
